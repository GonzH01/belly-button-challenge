- **Test Subject Selector**: A dropdown menu to select different test subjects and view their sample data.
- **Demographic Information**: Displays selected subject's demographic information, such as age, location, and ethnicity.
- **Bar Chart**: Shows the top 10 OTUs found in the selected individual, with hover text detailing the bacterial species.
- **Bubble Chart**: Visualizes the relative frequency of all OTUs found in the selected individual, with bubble size representing the abundance of each OTU.

## Technologies Used
- **D3.js**: For data manipulation and binding data to DOM elements.
- **Plotly.js**: To create interactive charts.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive layout and styling.
